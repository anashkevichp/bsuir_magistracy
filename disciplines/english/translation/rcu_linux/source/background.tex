\section{Background}

\subsection{What is RCU?}

Read-copy update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism
that is often used to replace reader-writer locking.
RCU readers run concurrently with updaters,
and so RCU avoids read-side contention by maintaining multiple versions of
objects and ensuring 
they are not freed until all pre-existing readers complete, that is,
until after a \emph{grace period} elapses.
The basic idea is to split updates into removal
and reclamation phases that are separated by a grace period~\cite{McKenneyRCU98}.
The removal phase removes reader-accessible references 
to objects, perhaps by replacing them with new versions.

Modern CPUs guarantee that writes to single aligned
pointers are atomic, so that readers
see either the old or new version of the data structure.
These atomic-write semantics enable atomic
insertions, deletions, and replacements in a linked structure.
This in turn enables readers to dispense with expensive
atomic operations, memory barriers, and cache misses.
In fact, in the most aggressive configurations of Linux-kernel RCU, readers
can use exactly the same sequence of instructions that would be used in
a single-threaded implementation, providing
RCU readers with excellent performance and scalability.

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:rcu_concepts}, grace periods are only
needed for those readers whose runtime overlaps the removal phase.
Those that start after the removal 
phase cannot hold references to the removed objects and thus
cannot be disrupted by objects being freed during the reclamation phase.
