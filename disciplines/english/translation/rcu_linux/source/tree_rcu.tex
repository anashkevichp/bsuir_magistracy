\section{Implementation of Tree RCU}\label{sec:tree_rcu}

The primary advantage of RCU is that it is able to wait for an arbitrarily
large number of readers to finish without keeping track every single one of
them.  The number of readers can be large (up to the number of CPUs in
non-pre\-emptible implementations and up to the number of tasks in
preemptible implementations).
%
Although RCU's read-side primitives enjoy excellent performance and scalability, 
update-side primitives must defer the reclamation phase till all pre-existing 
readers have completed, either by blocking or by registering a callback that is 
invoked after a grace period. The performance and scalability of RCU relies on 
efficient mechanisms to detect when a grace period has completed. 
%
For example, a simplistic RCU implementation might require each CPU to
acquire a global lock during each grace period, but this would severely
limit performance and scalability.
Such an implementation would be quite unlikely to scale beyond
a few hundred CPUs.
This is woefully insufficient because Linux runs on systems with thousands
of CPUs.
This has motivated the creation of Tree RCU.

\subsection{Overview}
% Lihao: include this in PhD thesis; also look for 'preemptible RCU contents' 
%There are several flavors of RCU, including RCU-sched, RCU-preempt, 
%RCU Bot\-tom-Half, and Sleepable RCU (SRCU)~\cite{MckenneyRCUflavors}.
% Different flavors have different quiescent states, which are 
% discussed in Section \ref{sec:quiescent_state}.
%
% Classic RCU has two implementations: Tiny RCU and Tree RCU. Tiny RCU
% is only for uni-processor systems; we therefore focus on Tree RCU in this paper.
% Tree RCU further has non-pre\-emptible and preemptible variants, 
% configured by the kernel Kconfig option \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT}.
% There is no preemptible implementation of Tiny RCU: Instead,
% preemptible Tree RCU is used in single-CPU preemptible kernel builds.
%
% Tree RCU implements RCU-sched, RCU-bh, and RCU-preempt when \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=y}.
% If \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=n}, then RCU-preempt is mapped into RCU-sched.
% Tiny RCU requires \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=n}, so it also maps
% RCU-preempt into RCU-sched.
%
We focus on the ``vanilla'' RCU API in a non-preemptible build of
the Linux kernel, specifically on the \co{rcu_read_lock()},
\co{rcu_read_unlock()}, and \co{synchronize_rcu()} primitives.

%\comment{Lihao: it seems the Tree implementation of Classic RCU also 
%implements other three flavors: RCU-sched, RCU-bh, and RCU-preempt;
%and Tiny RCU implements RCU-sched and RCU-bh. Am I right?
%Conceptually, what is the relationship between flavors Classic RCU and 
%RCU-sched/RCU-bh? I shall discuss their relationship here otherwise 
%readers may get confused when we discuss different flavors in the 
%Tree RCU implementation in later sections.}
%\comment{Paul: 
%	Yes, Tree RCU implements RCU-sched, RCU-bh, and RCU-preempt,
%	but only when \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=y}.
%	If \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=n}, then RCU-preempt is mapped into
%	RCU-sched.
%	Because Tiny RCU is requires \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=n}, it behaves
%	the same as does Tree RCU when \co{CONFIG_PREEMPT=n},
%	implementing RCU-sched and RCU-bh, and mapping RCU-preempt into
%	RCU-sched.
%	For RCU-preempt, any location outside of an RCU read-side
%	critical section is a quiescent state.
%	For RCU-sched, context switch, idle, userspace,
%	\co{cond_resched_rcu_qs()}, and offline are all quiescent
%	states.
%	For RCU-bh, any location where bottom-half execution is enabled
%	is a quiescent state.
%	Use RCU-sched when you need updaters to wait on hardware interrupt
%	handlers (device drivers) or preempt-disable regions (tracing).
%	Use RCU-bh when networking denial-of-service attacks are a potential
%	issue.}
%
% In a non-pre\-empt\-ible kernel, Tiny and Tree RCU use the same
% \co{rcu_read_lock()} and \co{rcu_read_unlock()} implementation.
% Tiny RCU's \co{synchronize_rcu()} implementation is trivial, 
% while preemptible and non-pre\-emptible Tree RCU largely share a rather
% elaborate implementation.
% 
The key idea is that RCU read-side primitives are confined to kernel code and,
in non-pre\-emptible implementations, do not block.
Thus, when a CPU is blocking, in the idle loop, or running in user mode,
all RCU read-side critical sections that were previously running on that CPU
must have finished. Each of these states is therefore called a \emph{quiescent state}. 
After each CPU has passed through a quiescent state, the corresponding RCU grace period ends.
%\comment{Paul: Shouldn't the definition of quiescent state be before the
%first use?}
%\comment{Lihao: move here from the Read-Side Primitives subsection} 
% \comment{Lihao: add an overview and high-level idea of how the implementation of Tree RCU works.}
The key challenge is to determine when all necessary quiescent
states have completed for a given grace period---and to do so with
excellent performance and scalability.

For example, if RCU used a single data structure to record each CPU's
quiescent states, the result would be extreme lock contention on large systems,
in turn resulting in poor performance and abysmal scalability.
Tree RCU therefore instead uses a tree hierarchy of data structures, 
each leaf of which records quiescent states of a single CPU and propagates the information 
up to the root. When the root is reached, a grace period has ended. Then the grace-period
information is propagated down from the root to the leaves of the tree.
Shortly after the leaf data 
structure of a CPU receives this information, \co{synchronize_rcu()} will return.

In the remainder of this section, we discuss the implementation of the non-pre\-empt\-ible 
Tree RCU in the Linux kernel version 4.3.6. We first briefly discuss the implementation of 
read/write-side primitives.
%how non-pre\-empt\-ible Tree RCU detects quiescent states without individually tracking readers.
We then explain Tree RCU's hierarchical data structure which records quiescent states while 
maintaining bounded lock contention. Finally, we discuss how RCU uses this data structure 
to detect quiescent states and %communicate them among all the CPUs, as well as to detect a 
grace periods without individually tracking readers.
